# AI-Image-Processing
Key Tasks Involved

    Image Preprocessing: Use OpenCV and PIL for resizing, cropping, normalizing, etc.
    Data Augmentation: Apply transformations to artificially expand your dataset.
    CNN for Image Classification: Use a simple CNN model.
    Generative Models (e.g., GAN): Implementing a basic generative adversarial network.
    Style Transfer: Using pretrained models to apply style transfer.

We’ll assume you're already familiar with some concepts, so here’s a general structure you can adapt based on your specific project.
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install numpy tensorflow pytorch torchvision opencv-python Pillow

Step 2: Image Preprocessing & Augmentation

We'll start by writing a function for data augmentation (like random flips, rotations, etc.) using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator or PyTorch's transforms.
Example of Image Augmentation using TensorFlow:

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Define the data augmentation pipeline
def augment_image(image):
    datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        rotation_range=40,
        width_shift_range=0.2,
        height_shift_range=0.2,
        shear_range=0.2,
        zoom_range=0.2,
        horizontal_flip=True,
        fill_mode='nearest'
    )
    
    # Reshape image to have a batch dimension
    image = image.reshape((1,) + image.shape)
    
    # Generate augmented images
    it = datagen.flow(image, batch_size=1)
    
    # Get one augmented image
    augmented_image = it.next()
    return augmented_image[0].astype('uint8')

# Example usage:
image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('path_to_image.jpg')
image_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)
augmented_image = augment_image(image_array)

Step 3: Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

Now let’s define a simple CNN model to process the image data.

from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_cnn_model():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # For classification of 10 classes
    ])
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Example usage:
cnn_model = create_cnn_model()
cnn_model.summary()

Step 4: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation

GANs are popular for generating images. Here's a basic structure for a GAN model.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def build_generator():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=100),
        layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(28 * 28 * 1, activation='tanh'),
        layers.Reshape((28, 28, 1))  # Example: Output a 28x28 grayscale image
    ])
    return model

def build_discriminator():
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
        layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output probability
    ])
    return model

def build_gan(generator, discriminator):
    discriminator.trainable = False
    model = models.Sequential([generator, discriminator])
    return model

# Example usage:
generator = build_generator()
discriminator = build_discriminator()
gan_model = build_gan(generator, discriminator)
gan_model.summary()

Step 5: Implementing Style Transfer

We can use TensorFlow or PyTorch for style transfer. Here’s an example of how to implement style transfer using a pre-trained model in TensorFlow.

import tensorflow as tf

# Load pre-trained VGG19 model for style transfer
vgg = tf.keras.applications.VGG19(include_top=False, weights='imagenet')

# Preprocessing function
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3)
    img = tf.image.resize(img, (224, 224))
    img = tf.keras.applications.vgg19.preprocess_input(img)
    return img[tf.newaxis, :]

# Style transfer function
def apply_style_transfer(content_image_path, style_image_path):
    content_image = preprocess_image(content_image_path)
    style_image = preprocess_image(style_image_path)
    
    # Define model for extracting features from the layers
    outputs = [layer.output for layer in vgg.layers]
    model = tf.keras.models.Model(inputs=vgg.input, outputs=outputs)
    
    content_features = model(content_image)
    style_features = model(style_image)
    
    # You can use these features to compute loss and optimize the image here
    
    return content_features, style_features

# Example usage:
content_image_path = 'path_to_content_image.jpg'
style_image_path = 'path_to_style_image.jpg'
content_features, style_features = apply_style_transfer(content_image_path, style_image_path)

Step 6: Putting Everything Together

Now that we have several core components ready (like augmentation, CNN, GAN, and style transfer), you can integrate them into your project pipeline. You can preprocess your data, augment it, train your CNN or GAN, and apply style transfer to images as needed.
Example Integration into a Pipeline:

def main():
    # Load and preprocess data
    image = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img('path_to_image.jpg')
    image_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(image)

    # Apply data augmentation
    augmented_image = augment_image(image_array)
    
    # Train CNN model (dummy example)
    cnn_model = create_cnn_model()
    cnn_model.fit(augmented_image, augmented_image, epochs=10)  # Dummy training loop
    
    # Generate image using GAN
    noise = tf.random.normal([1, 100])  # Latent vector for GAN
    generated_image = generator(noise)

    # Apply style transfer
    content_image_path = 'path_to_content_image.jpg'
    style_image_path = 'path_to_style_image.jpg'
    content_features, style_features = apply_style_transfer(content_image_path, style_image_path)

    # Show results (This would be more complex with actual image rendering)
    print("Style Transfer applied.")
    print("Generated Image from GAN: ", generated_image.shape)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Next Steps:

    Data Augmentation: More complex augmentation strategies could be added (e.g., random crops, lighting adjustments, etc.).
    Model Training: For both CNN and GAN, you would need a dataset and a training loop to fit the models.
    Evaluation: Implement evaluation metrics to assess how well your models are performing (for example, using accuracy for CNN or FID for GANs).
    Fine-Tuning: Depending on the application (e.g., style transfer), you might fine-tune existing models or use transfer learning for better performance.

Conclusion:

This code provides the foundation for implementing computer vision tasks in an image generation project. You can extend it by improving the models, refining the augmentation techniques, or applying it to specific real-world tasks such as art generation, image enhancement, or style transfer. Make sure to adapt and fine-tune the code to your specific requirements and dataset!
